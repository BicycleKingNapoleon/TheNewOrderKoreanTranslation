 POLITICS_ADOLFO_LOPEZ_MATEOS_DESC:0 "While the world journeys onwards with the cracking bells of revolution and the marching boots of invasion, some men must find themselves able to write themselves out of the hell of ignorance and resistance. Adolfo López Mateos stands as one of these men, dedicating himself as a man for his country in his work as a simple secretary before his rise to electoral success in the Mexican Senate, a place as equally fiery and changing as the Revolution that instituted it in the first place. Smiles, shaking hands, and attending parties would dominate his next few years, as through the hands of smiling friends in the Senate came the birth of his new title, as Secretary of Labor in the wake of the position's immense growth.\n\nAs the Nazi raged across Europe and the Japanese blitzed across the Pacific, Mexico stood shakily by, with Mateos swearing by the Estrada Doctrine as his gospel of neutrality in hopes of preserving a safe and secure Mexican nation. And through this neutrality came pesos for the Mexican, as Mateos continued to drive forth ideals of neutrality backed by Mexican nationalism, seeking to bring the Mexican working class together and managed to win the Presidency after his nomination by the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1958. Through his Presidency, Mateos has worked diligently to ensure that the Mexican state maintains unity and independence past the grabbing hands of powers throughout the world.\n\nHowever, President Adolfo López Mateos's fight for Mexico's individuality continues to entrench itself across the country. Throughout the Mexican government, Senators, Deputies, and Mateos's own cabinet officials find themselves wooed by the ever growing influence of the Americans and the Japanese, where some have argued the path for Mexico's future, and the path to economic boom, lie. With discussions of trade and the end of Mateos's Presidency on the horizon, the questions of Mexico's future lie on everyone's mind, as the PRI's one party domination means a choice for Mateo to choose an heir to his Presidential throne, one who may throw the country to American or Japanese winds..."

 POLITICS_LUIS_ECHEVARRIA_DESC:0 "To much of the world, Luis Echeverría Álvarez is a chimera, a stitched-together symbol of everything wrong with the PRI.  To the people of Mexico, he is much the same, but he portrays himself as everything RIGHT with the PRI.  Born in Mexico City in 1922, Echeverría joined the party as a young man.  He quickly gained favor in the office of the Party President, and over the decades, he would move from job to job, culminating in a stint as Secretary of Exterior Relations.  Now, as President of the United Mexican States, he seeks to establish Mexico as a truly independent nation, insulated from the great power conflicts of the present age, and secure in its neutrality.  The American and Japanese corporate barons have other plans, of course, but they will face a fearsome man in Echeverría.  If he succeeds, Mexico will achieve that revolutionary goal of standing on its own, free from the interference of foreign capital.\n\nWith himself in charge, of course."

 POLITICS_RAUL_LOZANO_DESC:0 "Raul Salinas Lonzano is a true product of the twentieth century in Mexico, in both a positive and negative sense.\n\nBorn near the Mexico-U.S border in Nuevo Leon, Lonzano studied at the Autonomous University of Mexico, the American University in Washington, and Harvard before entering Mexican politics under the Mateos government. A classically liberal counter to the historically protectionist Mexican economic climate, his presidential nomination surprised many. He campaigned on lowering taxes and opening Mexico's borders to all sorts of foreign capital, positing an open economy to the path to national wealth. However, his ties to the gargantuan Japanese Zaibatsus have caused quite a bit of controversy, both in the Mexican political establishment and the American embassy in Mexico City. Whether or not his presidency will be a opening for Tokyo's influence in Latin America is yet to be seen.\n\nAlthough the idea of his government might seem discomforting to some, Lozano believes that the time has come for Mexico to forge its own path in the world."

 POLITICS_GUSTAVO_ORDAZ_DESC:0 "The dust has settled over the arid lands of Mexico, and with it, a new President and Face of the Institutional Revolutionary Party comes to sit in the greatest position in all of Mexico. Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, well-known for having worked as the Minister of the Interior under President Adolfo López Mateos, has come to power, leaving the youth and powerful in a state of unknown regarding the future of their country.\n\nPresident Ordaz, in his past, was well known for having a stone-cold attitude in regards to the fire of the youth, and has been either praised for, or accused of, depending on who you ask, masterminding the falls of various protests led by students and lesser-powerful social groups throughout Mexico. Meanwhile, the other most prominent feature of Ordaz's political past has been his fierce goading of the Mexican government towards a pro-American stance, and has been documented as having advocated for the pushing of greater nations towards the government of our Northern border. Some accuse Gustavo Díaz Ordaz as being backwater, and against reforms which may help reshape the national power of the Mexican nation through his undermining of student protests and other liberal-minded calls for change. Some accuse Gustavo Díaz Ordaz as being a sellout to both the United States government and the businessmen who trail behind it, willing to sell the Mexican nation into obedience towards the American President and his administration.\n\nNo matter who you ask, however, all can agree on one thing: Gustavo Díaz Ordaz is a man ready to dig in to preserve his country through the status-quo, and a man with a strong enough will to do it."

MEX_Economic_Battlefield:0 "경제의 전장"
MEX_Economic_Battlefield_desc:0 "혁명의 여파로 우리나라는 우리 경제의 대외통제를 끝내기 위해 국유화와 보호무역주의를 실시했고 그 결과, 거의 경제적 빈곤국이 되었습니다. 포르피리아토 기간 동안 이들에게 줄 수 있는 큰 돈들에 익숙해져갔고, 미국과 그 너머에서 벌어 들인 이익은 멕시코에서 우위를 되찾기로 결심한 혁명의 승자들에게 로비하는 데에 사용했습니다. 제2차 세계대전은 이러한 시도를 극적인 방식으로 끝냈습니다. 절박해진 전쟁에 연료를 공급하기 위해 멕시코 석유에 의존한 미국인들은 경제적 정복에 대한 꿈을 포기했습니다.\n\n그 이후로, 멕시코는 전 세계에 상품과 석유를 판매하면서 중립을 통해 스스로를 위해 매우 잘 해왔습니다. 그러나 이 경제적 기적은 그 자체로 양날의 검을 증명했습니다. 그들의 욕구는 현재의 번영에 젖어 있었으며, 대다수의 지식인들은 OFN과 공영권 간의 입찰 전쟁을 이용해 이익과 멕시코의 국제적 명성을 높이는 것을 꿈꿉니다. 이미 미국의 대기업과 일본의 자이바츠는 멕시코 문제에서 패권을 놓고 충돌하고 있습니다. 혁명의 이상에서 벗어나려는 서민들의 경계심에도 불구하고, 우리 정치인들 중 일부는 멕시코 중립의 종말을 계획하고 있는 것 같습니다."
MEX_Fraying_Ideals:0 "닳아버린 이상"
MEX_Fraying_Ideals_desc:0 "혁명의 진정한 의미를 둘러싼 싸움이 시작되었을 때, 멕시코 혁명의 길고 피비린내 나는 격변은 아직 끝나지 않았습니다. 멕시코 민주주의를 포르피리오 디아스와 그의 부패한 씨엔티피코 파벌로부터 해방시키기 위한 투쟁이였습니까, 아니면 경제의 외국 지배를 끝내기 위한 국민들의 봉기였었습니까? 폭력의 소용돌이에 파벌들이 있었던 만큼 혁명의 이유도 많았습니다. 결국, 승리자들은 PRI, "해방혁명당" 또는 "제도혁명당"을 창당했습니다. 이 승리자들은 이 모든 것이 무엇 때문이었는지를 결정하기 위해 행동했고, 분단된 국가를 통합했습니다.\n\nN이제 PRI는 아이러니하게도 옛 포르피리오의 과두정치를 떠올리게 하는 생물체로 진화했습니다. 멕시코에서 가장 우세한 정당인 PRI는 당을 지지하는 노조와 기술원, 정치인의 대규모 연합을 깨뜨리려고 시작하며, 우리가 어렵게 쟁취한 경제적 독립성을 훼손하려는 외국 계획의 표적이 되었습니다. 많은 사람들은 이제 이데올로기적 갈등에 휩싸였고, 아돌포 마테오스 내각에서 제일 문제시 되는 나쁜 사건입니다. 비록 어느 쪽도 우위를 점하지 못하지만, 한 가지 확실한 것은 어느 파벌이 승리하느냐가 당의 미래를 결정지을 것이며, 이에 따라 멕시코의 미래를 결정지을 것 입니다."
