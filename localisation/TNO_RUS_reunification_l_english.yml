First, we can do this discreetly, only sending a minor amount of funds that would provide a mild boost in popularity. This has a very low chance of backfiring on us, and isn't going to be a major step forward, but something is better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, we could begin publicly endorsing pro-unification groups within [From.GetNameDef].

No doubt soldiers and generals from both sides will benefit massively from such an exchange of expertise and skill, and perhaps even stoke great rivalries capable of pushing each other's acumen to greater heights. Nevertheless, some of our more cautious generals advise against so freely offering a potential adversary access to the nation's military secrets."

Either way, both our nations' armies will have to make do without the added experience."

First, we can do this discreetly, only sending a minor amount of funds that would provide a mild boost in popularity. This has a very low chance of backfiring on us, and isn't going to be a major step forward, but something is better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, we could begin publicly endorsing pro-unification groups within [From.GetNameDef].

[ROOT.GetLeader]'s economists believe our industries will benefit from the raw materials [GetOtherRegionalName] has offered, though a sizable faction also argues against handing our precious ores to another state.\n\nOn the other hand, we can also consider paying for a fraction of their oil reserves in specie. The black gold is ever an essential luxury in war-torn Russia; building up our stockpiles thereof may yield more benefit than exchanging raw material for raw material."

In extended detail, the government of [GetOtherRegionalName] has quietly stated a list of reasons by which they have stated an inability to attend the Conference we have set up regarding the unification of our states, most of all their hesitance to surrender [GetOtherRegionalName]'s autonomy. This presents a significant issue in regards to our potential for a peaceful unification of Russians of the land, and sends a wave of unpreparedness and worry over the potentially deadly future of our time."
